Pandora is a high-performance load generator in Go language. It has built-in HTTP(S) and HTTP/2 support and you can write your own load scenarios in Go, compiling them just before your test.

## Documentation
[Documentation](https://yandex.github.io/pandora/)

## How to start

### Binary releases
[Download](https://github.com/yandex/pandora/releases) available.

### Building from sources
We use go 1.11 modules.
If you build pandora inside $GOPATH, please make sure you have env variable `GO111MODULE` set to `on`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yandex/pandora.git
cd pandora
make deps
go install
```

Or let [Yandex.Tank](https://yandextank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_and_modules.html#pandora) make it easy for you.


## Extension points

You can write plugins with the next [extension points](https://github.com/progrium/go-extpoints):

You can also cross-compile for other arch/os:
```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
```

### Running your tests
Run the binary with your config (see config examples at [examples](https://github.com/yandex/pandora/tree/develop/examples)):

```bash
# $GOBIN should be added to $PATH
pandora myconfig.yaml
```

Or use Pandora with [Yandex.Tank](https://yandextank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_and_modules.html#pandora) and
[Overload](https://overload.yandex.net).

## Performance tests

These tests are run when a release is created from a tag. See [.github/workflows/yc.yml](.github/workflows/yc.yml)

The scripts used to run are [performance-test/automation](performance-test/automation)

And the tests are in the following directory - [performance-test/test-config](performance-test/test-config). 
Where one directory is one test. 
Each test has a autostop point configured. 
When all tests pass, all their autostop points will be written in the release description.
